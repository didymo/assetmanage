Asset_manage is part of the service clubs package. The project base can be found at https://github.com/didymo/service-project-base.

The purpose of asset manage is to provide a module that allows users to easily add and track relevant information associated with assets. Information such as an image and description are also incorporated into an assets details. It's useful for businesses and event management allowing organisers to budget and maintain assets. This is done by providing an easy to access list ordered by expiry date. Assets can be viewed in groups based off how close to an expiry date it is. The asset information is provided in such a simple and straightforward manner and is easily viewable by both the organisers of events and general public volunteers.

The module also provides a useful tool to link assets to each other through dependencies. In doing so it makes the job of an organiser extremely easy to see the chain or connections of assets to one another, and expiry dates of parts and features associated with an asset. When connections are made the list feature can display all assets that are associated with an expired asset, as the operation or use of an asset may be depenedent upon it's counterparts which have expired. This feature will be useful to you as it can save a great deal of hassle trying to manage all the assets in your business.

As an example of this module in use a small business can add it's assets to the website such as:
- Gas canisters
- Food products
- Mechanical equipment (fridges)

After doing so, you can then view all assets as a comprehensive list including the dependencies on the gas canisters. If one of these was to expire, the system would show you which assets require the gas canister making your job of finding this informaton simple.

We recommend you use composer and do this through service project base.
